# SimpleBankingApp
This is a simple banking app that I am creating to help me with using classes. The purpose of this is to practice, this app is not meant for any production environment, and I am new to this space so.... Yeah. Not an expert.


This application has three built in accounts, 
 - 12345
 - 67890
 - admin

The first two are customer accounts so that you may test the Deposit and Withdraw functions, third is for the admin account. This will allow you to create additional accounts.
